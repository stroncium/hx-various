FastRNG.hx - fast Random Number Generator.
  - flash only.
  - /!\ ~15 times faster than Math.random() (for flash).
  - getUInt, getInt, getFloat, getBool, getBoundInt, getBoundsInt.
  - fast reinitialization with UInt number.
  - /!\ it's ~3.5 times faster to get a number(int, float, bounded int, 2-bounded int) from RNG than from Array.

FastRNG4.hx - fast Random Number Generator with extended period.
  - period is much longer(^4) than FastRNG's one.
  - 40% slower than FastRNG.
  - everything else is the same.
